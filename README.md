Walmart Sales Forecasting Project
This notebook develops a time series forecasting model to predict weekly sales for Walmart stores. It is structured to deliver both insights and forecasts that help manage inventory and match supply with demand.

Key Components:
Problem Statement:

A retail chain with stores across the country is facing challenges in aligning supply with demand.

The goal is to analyze historical sales data and forecast weekly sales for the next 12 weeks.

Data Source:

The dataset includes store-level historical sales and features like:

Date, Weekly_Sales, Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Initial inspection includes checking for null values, understanding distributions, and identifying seasonal or holiday effects on sales.

Data Preparation:

Focused on time series modeling, non-essential variables are dropped.

Only Date and Weekly_Sales are retained to build the model.

Modeling Approach:

A time series forecasting technique (likely ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet) is used to predict sales.

The model aims to forecast the next 12 weeks of sales based on past trends.

Outcome:

The model can support inventory planning, marketing decisions, and resource allocation.
